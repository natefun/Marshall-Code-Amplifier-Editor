# Marshall-Code-Editor

Allows you to send configuration to a Marshall CODE guitar amplifier. This will allow you to create, modify, and save presets/patches.

Despite the licence (see below) saying thatit is open source I was not able to find source code for it. I ran the compiled exe file through JetBrains dotPeek to decompile it to the C# .NET source code. I then corrected some errors with the decompilation and published this. This should still be within the licence.
This source code should be fully operational and function the same as the full release found here
